# Ideas
- Rename DownloadFile to RemoteFile
- Box errors
- Info endpoint, to view file info
- On download, mention a wrong or missing password with a HTTP 401 response
- Automatically get owner token, from file history when setting password
- Implement error handling everywhere properly
- `-y` flag for assume yes
- `-f` flag for forcing (no interact?)
- Quick upload/download without `upload` or `download` subcommands.
- Set file password
- Set file download count
- Flag to explicitly delete file after download
- Check remote version and heartbeat using `/__version__`
- Check whether the file still exists everywhere
- API actions contain duplicate code, create centralized functions
- Download to a temporary location first
- Soft limit uploads to 1GB and 2GB
- Allow piping input/output files
- Allow file renaming on upload
- Allow file/directory archiving on upload
- Allow unarchiving on download 
- Allow hiding the progress bar, and/or showing simple progress
- Enter password through pinetry
- Remember all uploaded files, make files listable
- Incognito mode, to not remember files `--incognito`
- Document all code components
- Dotfile for default properties
- Host configuration file for host tags, to easily upload to other hosts
- Generate manual pages
- Automated releases through CI
- Release binaries on GitHub
- Ubuntu PPA package
- Move API URL generator methods out of remote file class
- Prompt if a file download password is required
- Do not allow empty passwords (must force with `-f`)
