# Ideas
- allow creating non existent directories with the `-f` flag 
- only allow file extension renaming on upload with `-f` flag
- `-y` flag for assume yes
- `-f` flag for forcing (no interact?)
- Box errors
- On download, mention a wrong or missing password with a HTTP 401 response
- Automatically get owner token, from file history when setting password
- Implement error handling everywhere properly
- Quick upload/download without `upload` or `download` subcommands?
- Flag to explicitly delete file after download
- Allow file deletion by consuming all download slots
- Check remote version and heartbeat using `/__version__`
- Check whether the file still exists everywhere
- API actions contain duplicate code, create centralized functions
- Download to a temporary location first
- Soft limit uploads to 1GB and 2GB
- Allow piping input/output files
- Allow file/directory archiving on upload
- Allow unarchiving on download 
- Allow hiding the progress bar, and/or showing simple progress
- Remember all uploaded files, make files listable
- Incognito mode, to not remember files `--incognito`
- Document all code components
- Dotfile for default properties
- Host configuration file for host tags, to easily upload to other hosts
- Generate man pages
- Automated releases through CI
- Release binaries on GitHub
- Ubuntu PPA package
- Move API URL generator methods out of remote file class
- Prompt if a file download password is required
- Do not allow empty passwords (must force with `-f`) (as not usable on web)
- Must use `-f` to overwrite existing file
- Rename host to server?
- Read and write files from and to stdin and stdout with `-` as file
- Ask to add MIME extension to downloaded files without one on Windows
- Fetch max file size from `server/jsconfig.js`
- Define a redirect policy (allow setting max redirects)
- Support servers that are hosted on a sub path (URL builder resets path)
